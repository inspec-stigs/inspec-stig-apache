  title 'Active software modules must be minimized.'
  desc 'Modules are the source of Apache httpd servers core and dynamic capabilities. Thus not every module available is needed for operation. Most installations only need a small subset of the modules available. By minimizing the enabled modules to only those that are required, we reduce the number of doors and have therefore reduced the attack surface of the web site. Likewise having fewer modules means less software that could have vulnerabilities.'
