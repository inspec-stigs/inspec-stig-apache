Shell programs might execute shell escapes and could then perform unauthorized activities that could damage the security posture of the web server. A shell is a program that serves as the basic interface between the user and the operating system. In this regard, there are shells that are security risks in the context of a web server and shells that are unauthorized in the context of the Security Features Users Guide.'
