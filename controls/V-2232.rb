  desc 'Normally, a service account is established for the web server. This is because a privileged account is not desirable and the server is designed to run for long uninterrupted periods of time. The SA or Web Manager will need password access to the web server to restart the service in the event of an emergency as the web server is not to restart automatically after an unscheduled interruption.  If the password is not entrusted to an SA or web manager the ability to ensure the availability of the web server is compromised.'

Query the SA or Web Manager to determine if they have the web service password(s).

If the web services password(s) are not entrusted to the SA or Web Manager, this is a finding.

NOTE: For installations that run as a service, or without a password, the SA or Web Manager having an Admin account on the system would meet the intent of this check.
