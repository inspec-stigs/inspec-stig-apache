# description: All directives specified in this STIG must be specifically set (i.e. the server is not allowed to revert to programmed defaults for these directives).  Included files should be reviewed if they are used.  Procedures for reviewing included files are included in the overview document.  The use of .htaccess files are not authorized for use according to the STIG.  However, if they are used, there are procedures for reviewing them in the overview document.  The Web Policy STIG should be used in addition to the Apache Site and Server STIGs in order to do a comprehensive web server review.

  desc 'Just as running unneeded services and protocols is a danger to the web server at the lower levels of the OSI model, running unneeded utilities and programs is also a danger at the application layer of the OSI model. Office suites, development tools, and graphical editors are examples of such programs that are troublesome. Individual productivity tools have no legitimate place or use on an enterprise, production web server and they are also prone to their own security risks.  '

If programs or utilities that meet the above criteria are installed on the Web Server, and appropriate documentation and signatures are in evidence, this is not a finding. 

Determine whether the web server is configured with unnecessary software. 

Determine whether processes other than those that support the web server are loaded and/or run on the web server. 

Examples of software that should not be on the web server are all web development tools, office suites (unless the web server is a private web development server), compilers, and other utilities that are not part of the web server suite or the basic operating system. 

Check the directory structure of the server and ensure that additional, unintended, or unneeded applications are not loaded on the system. 

If, after review of the application on the system, there is no justification for the identified software, this is a finding.
