  desc 'The Apache mod_dav and mod_dav_fs modules support WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning) functionality for Apache. WebDAV is an extension to the HTTP protocol which allows clients to create, move, and delete files and resources on the web server. WebDAV is not widely used, and has serious security concerns as it may allow clients to modify unauthorized files on the web server. Therefore, the WebDav modules mod_dav and mod_dav_fs should be disabled.'
